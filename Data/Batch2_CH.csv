1. Assume that you are working on a project creating an online document collaboratively.

3. For each message, you will be asked to evaluate how polite each message sounds to you using the slider as shown below.



4. Additionally, you will highlight the parts of each message that most affect your perception of the message's politeness. You can select more than a part of the message if you need to.

To highlight the parts, first, click or drag the parts and click the green highlight button as below.
